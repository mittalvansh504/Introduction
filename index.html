        <p>Hi,
            I'm <span class="special">Vansh Mittal</span>. I hail from <span class="special">Shamli (Uttar
                Pradesh)</span>. I'm pursuing my Bachelor's of Engineering from <span class="special">NIET (Noida
                Institute Of Engineering and Technology) College of Engineering</span>, Goutam Budh Nagar in Information
            and technology.

            Talking about my technical skills; I'm proficient in Python, C++, java, html, Flask with good knowledge.

            Also, as a student of Web development. I have knowledge web pages and experience of implementing in my
            recently completed internship as a web developer from Codesoft.

            Additionally, I'm an enthusiastic person and loves keeping updated with current technologies and research in
            AI.</p>

        <p>I'm working on this and excited to share the development of this project in the Tech world.

            Talking about my strengths, I consider myself as detail oriented, and well organised person.

            And I will call it short comings and not weakness particularly some of those would be I taking things very
            seriously and likes to work alone in my zone sometimes. But that doesn't mean I can't work in a team. I
            absolutely love to but sometimes I like my own space.

            Talking about my hobbies, I primarily play tabla it's a North Indian classical instrument and I also play
            various other instruments. I like to write articles, blogs, poetry.

            And that's all about me. Once again thank you so much for providing me this opportunity to talk about
            myself.

            Thank you.</p>

        <p>
            Once again, thank you for allowing me to share a bit about myself
